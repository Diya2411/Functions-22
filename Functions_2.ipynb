        "1. What are data structures, and why are they important?\n",
        "Answer- Data structures are fundamental ways to organize and store data efficiently, enabling computers to process and manipulate information effectively. They are important because they allow for optimized code, easier understanding, and efficient storage and retrieval of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples.\n",
        "Answer- Mutable Data Types:\n",
        "Definition: Mutable data types are those whose values can be modified after they are created.\n",
        "Examples:\n",
        "->Lists: We can add, remove, or change elements within a list.\n",
        "->Dictionaries: We can add, remove, or modify key-value pairs in a dictionary.\n",
        "->Sets: We can add or remove elements from a set.\n",
        "->User-defined classes: Instances of classes can often be modified.\n",
        "\n",
        "Immutable Data Types:\n",
        "Definition:Immutable data types are those whose values cannot be modified after they are created.\n",
        "Examples:\n",
        "->Strings: Once a string is created, we cannot change its characters; we can only create a new string.\n",
        "->Tuples: We cannot change the elements of a tuple once it's created.\n",
        "Numbers (integers, floats, etc.): Once a number is assigned, its value cannot be changed.\n",
        "->Booleans: Similar to numbers, booleans are immutable.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python.\n",
        "Answer- Lists:\n",
        "Mutability: Lists are mutable, meaning we can add, remove, or modify elements after they are created.\n",
        "Syntax: Lists are defined using square brackets [].\n",
        "Example: my_list = [1, 2, 3].\n",
        "Operations: Lists support various methods for modification, such as append(), insert(), remove(), etc.\n",
        "Memory Usage: Lists generally consume more memory than tuples.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tuples:\n",
        "Mutability: Tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed once they are created.\n",
        "Syntax: Tuples are defined using parentheses ().\n",
        "Example: my_tuple = (1, 2, 3).\n",
        "Operations: Tuples have fewer built-in methods compared to lists, as they are not designed for modification.\n",
        "Memory Usage: Tuples are more memory-efficient than lists because their size is fixed.\n",
        "Use Cases: Tuples are often used when you need to ensure data integrity and immutability, such as storing coordinates, function return values, or representing fixed sets of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Describe how dictionaries store data.\n",
        "Answer- Dictionaries are unordered collections of data and are represented with curly brackets { } . Like lists, dictionaries are mutable(changeable) and indexed. With dictionaries, data is stored in a key:value format. In this example, myCar is the variable that we have assigned our dictionary to.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python.\n",
        "Answer- We must use a set because sets cannot have multiple occurrences of the same element, it makes sets highly useful to efficiently remove duplicate values from a list or tuple and to perform common math operations like unions and intersections.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n",
        "Answer- Strings:\n",
        "->Represent textual data.\n",
        "->Are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed after creation.\n",
        "->Can be created using single quotes ('') or double quotes (\"\").\n",
        "->Can be accessed using indexing (starting from 0).\n",
        "->Examples: \"hello\", 'world'.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lists:\n",
        "->Can hold any type of data, including other lists, strings, numbers, etc.\n",
        "->Are mutable, meaning their contents can be modified after creation.\n",
        "->Are created using square brackets [].\n",
        "->Can be accessed using indexing (starting from 0).\n",
        "->Examples: [1, 2, 3], ['apple', 'banana'], [1, \"hello\", [1,2]].\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n",
        "Answer- Tuples are immutable to ensure that their contents remain constant throughout their lifecycle, guaranteeing data integrity and reliability. This immutability allows tuples to be used as keys in dictionaries and elements in sets, as they can be hashed.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n",
        "Answer- A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs using a hash function for fast access.\n",
        "In Python, dictionaries (dict) are implemented using hash tables, allowing O(1) average-time complexity for lookups, insertions, and deletions. They handle collisions using open addressing and dynamically resize for efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:student = {\"name\": \"Diya\", \"age\": 22}\n",
        "print(student[\"name\"])  # Output: Aisha\n",
        "student[\"city\"] = \"Bangalore\"  # Adding a new key-value pair\n",
        "Python dictionaries use hash tables for speed and flexibility, making them efficient for key-based data storage.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n",
        "Answer- Yes, a list in Python can contain different data types. Python lists are heterogeneous, meaning they can store elements of various types, including integers, floats, strings, booleans, other lists, tuples, dictionaries, and even functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: my_list = [25, \"hello\", 3.14, True, [1, 2, 3], {\"key\": \"value\"}]\n",
        "print(my_list)\n",
        "\n",
        "Output:[25, 'hello', 3.14, True, [1, 2, 3], {'key': 'value'}]\n",
        "This flexibility makes Python lists powerful for handling diverse data in a single collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python?\n",
        "Answer- Python strings are \"immutable\" which means they cannot be changed after they are created (Java strings also use this immutable style). Since strings can't be changed, we construct new strings as we go to represent computed values.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n",
        "Answer- Dictionaries in Python offer several advantages over lists for certain tasks, particularly when working with key-value pairs. Here are some key advantages:\n",
        "1. Faster Lookups (O(1) vs. O(n))\n",
        "Dictionary: Lookup time is O(1) on average because it uses a hash table.\n",
        "List: Lookup time is O(n) because it requires scanning the entire list to find an element.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Meaningful Data Organization\n",
        "Dictionaries use keys to describe values, making data more readable.\n",
        "Lists store elements based on position, which may require additional context to understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Avoiding Duplicate Keys\n",
        "Dictionaries prevent duplicate keys, ensuring unique identifiers.\n",
        "Lists allow duplicate values, which may lead to confusion in key-value relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Faster Membership Checking (in operator)\n",
        "Checking if a key exists in a dictionary is O(1), whereas checking in a list is O(n).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Data Modification is Easier\n",
        "Dictionaries allow direct modification using keys, while in lists, you need to find the index first.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.\n",
        "Answer- A tuple is preferable over a list in scenarios where immutability, performance, and memory efficiency are important.\n",
        "\n",
        "Scenario: Storing Coordinates of a Location\n",
        "Imagine you are building a GPS application that needs to store latitude and longitude coordinates of locations.\n",
        "Why Use a Tuple?\n",
        "1. Immutability: Coordinates should not change after they are set, so using a tuple prevents accidental modification.\n",
        "2. Performance: Tuples are faster than lists because they require less memory and processing time.\n",
        "3. Hashability: Tuples can be used as keys in a dictionary or elements in a set, whereas lists cannot.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "location = (12.9716, 77.5946)  # Latitude and Longitude of Bangalore\n",
        "# Using tuple in a dictionary\n",
        "places = {(40.7128, -74.0060): \"New York\",\n",
        "          (48.8566, 2.3522): \"Paris\"}\n",
        "print(places[(40.7128, -74.0060)])  # Output: New York\n",
        "# Trying to modify a tuple (This will cause an error)\n",
        "location[0] = 13.0000  # TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n",
        "Answer- A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. It automatically removes duplicate values and supports operations like union, intersection, and difference.\n",
        "Example: Converting a List to a Set to Remove Duplicates\n",
        "sandal_list = [\"Nike\", \"Adidas\", \"Puma\", \"Nike\"]\n",
        "unique_sandals = set(sandal_list)\n",
        "print(unique_sandals)  \n",
        "# Output: {'Nike', 'Adidas', 'Puma'}\n",
        "\n",
        "14. How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n",
        "Answer- The in keyword is used to check for the presence of an element in both lists and dictionaries, but it works differently in each case.\n",
        "1. \"in\" with a List\n",
        "When used with a list, in checks whether a value exists in the list.\n",
        "sandal_list = [\"Nike\", \"Adidas\", \"Puma\"]\n",
        "print(\"Nike\" in sandal_list)   # True\n",
        "print(\"Reebok\" in sandal_list) # False\n",
        "Searches through all elements in the list.\n",
        "Time Complexity: O(n) (linear search).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. \"in\" with a Dictionary\n",
        "When used with a dictionary, in checks whether a key exists, not the value.\n",
        "sandal_dict = {\"Nike\": 5000, \"Adidas\": 4500, \"Puma\": 4000}\n",
        "print(\"Nike\" in sandal_dict)   # True (checks for key)\n",
        "print(\"Reebok\" in sandal_dict) # False\n",
        "print(5000 in sandal_dict)     # False (because it checks only keys)\n",
        "\n",
        "15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not?\n",
        "Answer- No, we cannot modify a tuple because it is immutable (fixed and unchangeable).\n",
        "Example (Not Allowed)\n",
        "sandal_tuple = (\"Nike\", \"Adidas\", \"Puma\")\n",
        "sandal_tuple[0] = \"Reebok\"  # ❌ TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n",
        "\n",
        "Workaround: Convert to List, Modify, Convert Back\n",
        "sandal_list = list(sandal_tuple)\n",
        "sandal_list[0] = \"Reebok\"\n",
        "sandal_tuple = tuple(sandal_list)\n",
        "print(sandal_tuple)  # ✅ ('Reebok', 'Adidas', 'Puma')\n",
        "\n",
        "Exception: Mutable Elements Inside a Tuple Can Change\n",
        "sandal_tuple = (\"Nike\", [\"Adidas\", \"Puma\"])\n",
        "sandal_tuple[1][0] = \"Reebok\"  # ✅ Allowed\n",
        "print(sandal_tuple)  # ('Nike', ['Reebok', 'Puma'])\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, the tuple stays immutable, but the list inside can change.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?\n",
        "Answer- A nested dictionary is a dictionary inside another dictionary. It allows you to store multiple levels of data in a structured way, making it useful for representing complex relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example Use Case: Employee Records\n",
        "Imagine you need to store details of employees in an organization, including their department, role, and salary.\n",
        "\n",
        "employees = {\n",
        "    \"emp1\": {\n",
        "        \"name\": \"Amit\",\n",
        "        \"department\": \"HR\",\n",

        "        \"department\": \"Finance\",\n",
        "        \"role\": \"Analyst\",\n",
        "        \"salary\": 60000\n",
        "    }\n",
        "}\n",
        "\n",
        "# Accessing nested dictionary data\n",
        "print(employees[\"emp2\"][\"role\"])  # Output: Developer\n",
        "\n",
        "17. Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary.\n",
        "Answer- Time Complexity of Accessing Elements in a Dictionary (Python)\n",
        "In Python, dictionaries are implemented using hash tables, which provide average-case constant time complexity for accessing elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Average-Case Time Complexity: O(1)\n",
        "When accessing an element using a key (dict[key]), Python computes the hash of the key and looks up the corresponding value.\n",
        "Since hash table lookups are nearly instantaneous, accessing an element is O(1) on average.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Worst-Case Time Complexity: O(n)\n",
        "In rare cases, if multiple keys have the same hash value (hash collisions), Python resolves them using a linked list or another structure.\n",
        "If all keys collide, searching for a key may require scanning multiple elements, making it O(n) in the worst case.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example of Accessing a Dictionary Element\n",
        "data = {\"name\": \"Amit\", \"age\": 25, \"city\": \"Bangalore\"}\n",
        "print(data[\"age\"])  # O(1) on average\n",
        "\n",
        "18. In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n",
        "Answer- Situations Where Lists Are Preferred Over Dictionaries\n",
        "While dictionaries offer fast lookups with key-value pairs, lists are preferred in certain situations due to their ordered nature and sequential data storage.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Maintaining Order\n",
        "Use a list when the order of elements matters.\n",
        "Lists preserve insertion order (since Python 3.7+), whereas dictionaries are unordered collections before Python 3.7.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Cherry\"]\n",
        "print(fruits[0])  # Output: Apple (maintains order)\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Sequential Access & Iteration\n",
        "If you need to iterate over elements frequently, lists are better.\n",
        "Accessing elements sequentially in a list (for loop) is efficient.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "for item in [10, 20, 30, 40]:\n",
        "    print(item)  # Easy iteration\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Memory Efficiency\n",
        "Lists are more memory-efficient than dictionaries because they store only values, whereas dictionaries store key-value pairs and require extra space for hashing.\n",
        "If memory usage is a concern and you don’t need key-value mapping, lists are better.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Simpler Data Structures\n",
        "When you only need a simple collection of elements without labels (keys), a list is sufficient.\n",
        "For example, storing student roll numbers:\n",
        "roll_numbers = [101, 102, 103, 104]  # No need for keys\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Storing Duplicate Values\n",
        "Lists allow duplicate values, but dictionaries do not.\n",
        "If you need repeated values, use a list.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "names = [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Alice\", \"Charlie\"]\n",
        "\n",
        "When NOT to Use a List (Prefer a Dictionary Instead)\n",
        "When you need fast lookups (O(1) for dictionaries, O(n) for lists).\n",
        "When data requires key-value pairs (e.g., mapping student names to grades).\n",
        "When working with unique keys (dictionaries enforce uniqueness).\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n",
        "Answer- Why Dictionaries are Unordered:\n",
        "->Focus on Key-Based Access:\n",
        "Dictionaries are designed for fast lookups based on keys, not for maintaining a specific sequence of items.\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Underlying Implementation:\n",
        "Dictionaries are often implemented using hash tables, which prioritize efficient key-based access over maintaining insertion order.\n",
        "\n",
        "-> No Index-Based Access:\n",
        "Unlike lists or tuples, you cannot access elements in a dictionary using an index (e.g., my_dict[2]). Instead, you access them using keys (e.g., my_dict[\"key\"]).\n",
        "\n",
        "How Unordered Nature Affects Data Retrieval:\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Order is Not Guaranteed:\n",
        "When you iterate through a dictionary (e.g., using a for loop), the order in which you get the keys (and therefore the values) is not guaranteed to be the same as the order in which they were inserted.\n",
        "\n",
        "-> No Position-Based Access:\n",
        "You cannot rely on the position of a key-value pair to retrieve it, as the position is not a meaningful property of a dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Implications for Certain Operations:\n",
        "If you need to process dictionary elements in a specific order, you will need to sort the keys or values before iterating or accessing them.\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Python 3.7+ and Insertion Order:\n",
        "While dictionaries in Python 3.7 and later versions do preserve insertion order as an implementation detail, it's still considered unordered, and you shouldn't rely on this behavior for all implementations.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n",
        "Answer- Difference Between List and Dictionary in Terms of Data Retrieval\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Access Method:\n",
